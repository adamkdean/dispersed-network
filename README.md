## Hello world

See the [hello-world app](http://hello-world.dispersed.network/).

```
$ dn status
Name: hello-world
Status: running
Version: 7

HOST                  IMAGE      CREATED               STATUS                LATENCY
vaermina.disperse...  6f0d8b9    a few seconds ago     up 3 seconds          52 ms
sanguine.disperse...  6f0d8b9    a few seconds ago     up 3 seconds          52 ms

## Intro

`Dispersed Network` is a proof of concept distributed serverless network comprised of custom `Control`, `Gateway`, and `Host` services, using `RabbitMQ (AMQP 0.9.1)`, `Redis 4.0`, `Docker Registry 2` services, and allowing the deploy and control of containerised serverless apps through the `dn` CLI tool.

## CLI

The `dn` CLI tool allows simple administration of applications on the network.

```
$ dn help

Usage: dn COMMAND

Commands:
  build       build application image
  create      create new application
  help        show usage
  list        list applications
  push        push application image to registry
  remove      remove application
  run         build, push, create, and start application
  start       start application
  status      show application status
  stop        stop application
  update      build, push, update application
  version     show version
```

### Hello World example app

Let's go through an example app. You can find the Dockerfile, App.config, and the Node.js application in the `apps/` directory of this repository.

1. Check there isn't already a `hello-world` app already running. App names are unique and cannot be shared.

```
$ dn list
APPLICATION                   CREATED               STATUS
blog (v4)                     a day ago             running
example (v1)                  a minute ago          running
```

2. Create the `App.config` file that provides app name/hostname configuration for our app. It is read by the CLI tool.

```
$ vi App.config

#
# hello-world example app config file
#
APP_NAME      hello-world
APP_HOSTNAME  hello-world.dispersed.network
```

3. Create the app (my layers were cached here because layered filesystems are awesome).

```
$ dn create

hello-world (hello-world.dispersed.network) created
```

4. Check app status.

```
$ dn status
Name: hello-world
Status: created
Version: 1

HOST                  IMAGE      CREATED               STATUS                LATENCY
```

5. Start app.

```
$ dn start
hello-world (hello-world.dispersed.network) started
```

6. Check app status.

```
$ dn status
Name: hello-world
Status: running
Version: 1

HOST                  IMAGE      CREATED               STATUS                LATENCY
sanguine.disperse...  6f0d8b9    a few seconds ago     up 12 seconds         48 ms
meridia.dispersed...  6f0d8b9    a few seconds ago     up 12 seconds         49 ms
vaermina.disperse...  6f0d8b9    a few seconds ago     up 12 seconds         49 ms
```

(Bonus, check it our here: http://hello-world.dispersed.network/)

7. Stop the app.

```
$ dn stop
hello-world (hello-world.dispersed.network) stopped
```

8. Check app status.

```
$ dn status
Name: hello-world
Status: stopped
Version: 1

HOST                  IMAGE      CREATED               STATUS                LATENCY
vaermina.disperse...  6f0d8b9    a minute ago          exited (0) 15 sec...  50 ms
sanguine.disperse...  6f0d8b9    a minute ago          exited (0) 15 sec...  50 ms
meridia.dispersed...  6f0d8b9    a minute ago          exited (0) 15 sec...  50 ms
```

9. Remove app.

```
$ dn remove
hello-world removed
```

10. Check app status (for the last time).

```
$ dn status
hello-world not found
```
